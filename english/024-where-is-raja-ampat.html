<p>Raja Ampat is a regency in West Papua province of the Republic of Indonesia. Its capital is <a href="025-waisai.html">Waisai</a>. It is a small coastal town located in Waigeo. There are four big islands in the regency, i.e. Waigeo, Salawati, Batanta and Misool. There are also a lot of small tropical islands in the regency. Most of these islands are surrounded by coral reef and white sandy beaches with coconut, ficus, and cattapa trees grow along  their coastal areas. From the air, we can see these islands look like groups of emerald jewels on turquoise and blue ocean. Under the water, we can see thousands of marine animals thrive in colorful coral reef. According to marine scientists who did researches in Raja Ampat, the marine bio-diversity of the archipelago is the highest in the world. That's why it attracts a lot of scuba divers, snorkelers, and birdwatchers to see it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
The most convenient way to enjoy Raja Ampat is by staying in a nice beach resort and then do day trips to any directions of the islands. For instance, visitors can stay in Waigeo island and then visit Piaynemo karst in the first day, Kabui bay and Mansuar in the second day and then visit Wayag in the third day. Or visitors can also stay in a homestay or resort and enjoy snorkeling or diving at the house reef as well as birding and wildlife watching in the nearby forest.
