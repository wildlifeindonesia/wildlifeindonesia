<header><h1>SNORKELING TOUR TO WONDAMA</h1></header>
<article><p>Wondama Bay is a very good destination for tourists who like snorkeling and other activities that are related to marine tourism. There are coral reef sites along the beaches inside of the bay which tourists can visit to enjoy swimming and snorkeling. Some of them can be found in Ketapang Lima, Sobei, Rowor, and Cape Duari.</p>
	<p>A lot of marine creatures can be seen in coral reef of Wondama Bay. Various kinds if corals can be seen in Wondama including brain coral, staghorn coral, star, smooth and massive star corals and a lot more. </p>

<p>	Beautiful fish such as anemonefish, parrotfish, butterflyfish, moorish idol, surgeonfish, damselfish, sweetlips can be seen from reef flat to fore reef areas. Sometimes we can see them moving in the water in a large school of fish.</p>
<p>In addition to swimming and snorkeling, tourists who are interested in traveling and spending their holiday in Wondama can also enjoy fishing, beach walking to see the scenery,  island hopping or just sunbathing at the beach.</p>
<p>As of today there are no dive shops that sell high quality snorkeling gear. So, I suggest that visitors bring their own mask, snorkel, and fins. Underwater camera such as Olympus TG-6 with its waterproof casing, Nikon W300, or Fujifilm XP-140 or other type of underwater camera will also be needed if visitors want to take pictures or videos of the marine life that they see.</p>
<p>Because Wondama Bay regency is located in remote area, please, make sure that you bring snorkeling gear that is in good working order. For those who are interested in wildlife, they can also bring binoculars and  spotting scope as well as camera with telephoto lens such as the Nikon Coolpix P1000, Sony HX400 and laser pointer (please, choose the one that emits green light).</p>
