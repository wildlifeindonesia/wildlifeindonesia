	 <p>Here is a vector illustration of a wooden sailboat that I created using Macromedia Freehand software. The software was bought by Adobe and its development was stopped. Users of Freehand who do not like Adobe illustrator decided to use other programs such as Corel Draw, Inkscape or Gravit.  Now vector drawing software can be downloaded for free from its official website. The software can be used to create various kinds of vector illustrations. Because the digital illustration is a vector one, it can be printed to any size. I exported the illustration in smaller size into png file and upload it into my zazzle software. The drawing is now available as printed illustration on t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and tote bags. </p> 
	 <h2>Carrying Cargo and Passengers</h2>
	 <p>The boat is a traditional phinisi sailing boat. It has been used by islanders in Celebes island of Indonesia to transport goods and people. Now, its design and construction has been modernized to carry tourists. Yes, the wooden sailing boat is also used as charter cruise boat that visits a lot of tropical islands in Indonesia with customized itinerary. There are a lot of dive tour companies that provide tours to remote islands using this wooden sailboat. </p>
	 <p>The prime mover of the boat is not sail anymore. The sails are for decoration to attract tourists. They can be used when it is necessary. However, most of the time, the boat will use marine diesel engine. The modernization of traditional wooden sailboat of phinisi affects its interior design. The cabins are transformed to look like a floating five star hotel.</p>
