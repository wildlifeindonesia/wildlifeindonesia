	<p>This is the picture of Bombardier Regional Jet CRJ 1000  airliner being parked next to Batik Air's <a href= "042-airbus-a320.html">Airbus A320</a> at Domine Eduard Osok airport of Sorong city.  The CRJ 1000 aircraft belongs to and is operated by <a href= "../nusantara/020-garuda-pancasila.html">Garuda</a>, a national flag carrier of Indonesia. Garuda Indonesia has got 18 aircrafts of this type and uses them to serve their passengers on short and medium domestic flights inside the country. The airplane has got very narrow body with two jet engines General Electric CF34-8 installed at the aft area of the fuselage. The engines have got 5:1 by pass ratio and a trust output of up to 14,510 lbf. Because of its slender body and powerful engine, the plane can travel faster. I often travel between Manokwari and Sorong or even to Sultan Hassanudin International airport of Makassar. So, I choose Garuda to bring me to the destinations that I want. The passenger carrying capacity of this plane is 96 people with 12 Executive Class and 84 Standard Economy Seats. Sitting inside the plane when flying above the clouds, I can feel that the airplane is quiet and fast. Drinks and snacks are provided by flight attendants in all flights. Because the manufacturer use new materials and technology for making this aircraft, we can feel that their airplane is light and strong. </p>

	<p>Last month I went to Sorong city from Manokwari by the airplane. I felt that the flight was smooth and faster. It was a little bumpy when flying through clouds particularly while descending and approaching the airport. However, my overall flight experience with this aircraft was pleasant.</p></br>

	<p>Passengers who are tall sitting at the window seats have to be careful. When the airplane has landed at her destination, they have to be aware of the existence of overhead locker or stowage bin. Most often, passengers who are not aware of it may accidently bump his head on to the locker.</p>
	<p>In addition to Garuda Indonesia that operates 18 planes, other airlines that use CRJ 1000 include Air Nostrum, ARIK Air, BRIT Air. From the official website of Bombardier, it says that a CRJ 1000 has got a maximum passenger capacity of 104 people, with a range of 1,650 NM (3'056 km), max. cruise speed of 0.82 Mach, and  max. take off weight of 91,800 lb. As of 2019, 63 aircrafts have been manufactured by Bombardier.</p>
	<p>The regional jet Bombardier CRJ1000 is comparable to several other planes that have become its main competitor's in world market such as Embraer E-jet families, Bombardier C-series (now part of Airbus regional jet program), Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ90, as well as Antonov-AN158 and Sukhoi Superjet. So far, more E-jet E190 have been manufactured than the CRJ 1000.</p> <i>This short review was written by Charles Roring</i></p></article>
