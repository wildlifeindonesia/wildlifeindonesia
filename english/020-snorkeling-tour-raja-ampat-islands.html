<p> I offer an adventure tour to south-eastern region of Raja Ampat where participants can enjoy swimming and snorkeling at uninhabited islands, go hiking and birding in the jungle, visit coastal village of Papuan people and see the wonderful scenery of the archipelago. The tour is based on the following itinerary:</p>

<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>We will leave Sorong city for south-east region of Waigeo island. It takes approximately 2 hours to reach it. Arriving at the guesthouse, we will unload our bags and check into the rooms. After a long trip from your country, you need to take a rest for a while. Lunch will be served to supply you with more energy needed for your adventure in Raja Ampat.</p>
<p>You could enjoy snorkeling at the house reef of the guesthouse. Prepare your snorkeling gear. Applying some liquid soap on the glasses of your mask will prevent fogging when you are in the water. Make sure that when you wear your snorkeling googles, they are perfectly fit on your face. Remove hair that is stuck between your face and sealing rubber of your mask. When everything is ok, you can start exploring the marine life at the front waters of your guesthouse. If you bring underwater camera, you can take pictures of Christmas Tree Worm, Burrowing Clams, Sea Stars, Table Corals and a lot of species of reef fish such as butterflyfish, wrasse, parrotfish, and a lot more.</p>
