	 <body><h1>Rainforest Tours in Tambrauw Mountains</h1>	 
<article>
<p>Tambrauw is located between the regencies of Manokwari and Sorong. Most of its land is still covered by pristine tropical rainforest that is home to a lot of species of plants and animals. As a tourist guide, I have organized numerous tours for visitors who want to explore the wealth of bio-diversity of the rainforest of Tambrauw. Birding and wildlife watching tours can be carried out in lowland and hill forest to watch birds of paradise, deer, soa-soa lizards, cuscus possum and bandicoot. The duration of the tour could be as short as 4 days/ 3 nights to as long as 1 to 2 weeks. During the tour, I, and some villagers, will organize day walks and night walks in the forest and along the sides of a river. Since there are no hotels or guesthouses in the forest, visitors will stay in tents that we build at the banks of the river. We provide tents, cooking and eating utensils so that our visitors do not have to bring heavy equipment for the tour.</p>
