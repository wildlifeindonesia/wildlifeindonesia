<h1>Blyth's Hornbill is Called Burung Taun-taun</h1>
<p>I frequently see Blyth's hornbills while trekking in the jungle around Manokwari, Wondama peninsula, Sorong, Tambrauw and Raja Ampat. The best spots to watch this bird are in the lowland and lower montane forests. In West Papua, we call it burung taun-taun. It is a big bird that likes to eat fruits of nutmeg and ficus trees.</p>
<p>Blyth's hornbills and other birds play very important role in the ecosystem of rainforest. They disperse seeds of the fruits that they eat. They can fly in a group of two, four or even thirty birds. I organize birding tours to rainforest in West Papua for birders who want to see hornbill and a lot of other tropical birds that are endemic to this region. Hornbills like to sleep in  high trees after sunset time. In order to avoid predators, perhaps snakes, Blyth's hornbills choose the tip parts of the twigs. The one on the top right is a male.</p>

<p>I have guided birdwatchers from Europe, North Americas, Asia and Australia to watch Blyth's hornbill in Manokwari, Tambrauw Mountains, Sorong and Raja Ampat islands. The best times to watch birds are in the mornings and in the afternoon before sunset. I and some of my friends built basecamps deep in the jungle for birdwatchers to stay for several nights in the tropical rainforest of West Papua to watch birds and other wild animals such as cuscus possum, wallaby, deer, soa-soa lizard, butterfly, beetles, and etc.</p>
<h3>Birding Tour West Papua</h3>
<p>If you are physically fit, then you can take a birding tour with me to rainforest in Waigeo and its surrounding islands. I have seen various species of tropical birds there. Some of them that I can identify are Red Bird of Paradise (paradisaea rubra), Wilson's Bird of Paradise, Palm Cockatoo, Sulphur Crested Cockatoo, Eclectus Parrot, Red-cheeked Parrots, Variable Goshawk, Western Crown Pigeon, Oriental Dollarbird, Yellow-faced Myna, White-breasted Wood Swallow, Hooded Butcherbird, Pied Imperial Pigeon Pinon Imperial Pigeon, and etc.</p>
<p>In addition to animals, visitors who take a birding and wildlife watching tour with me can also see a lot of unique plants in the villages and forest that we visit including banana, papaya, mango, jackfruit, matoa, durian, and rambutan trees. Wild flowers such as Beach Hibiscus, terrestrial orchid spathoglottis plicata, or various colors of hibiscus can be seen in the region.
Flights to Sorong and a birding trip to Manokwari and Wondama Regency.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live in the United States or in Europe and want to watch birds in Manokwari, Wondama Regency or even Raja Ampat, and its surrounding forest regions, first, you need to fly to Jakarta - the capital of Indonesia. </li>
<li>Second, you take a domestic flight served by Sriwijaya Air, Batik Air or Garuda to Manokwari city. I will meet you at the airport and organize your bird and wildlife tour to the forest of West Papua.</li></ul>
