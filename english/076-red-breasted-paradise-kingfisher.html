<p>Red-breasted Paradise Kingfisher (<i>Tanysiptera nympha</i>) lives in lowland and hill tropical forest of West Papua. I saw while guiding tourists in lowland forest of Sorong regency and Tambrauw regency. It has got pinkish red underparts as shown in the picture below. Its physical appearances  and sounds were similar to Common Paradise Kingfisher (<i>Tanysiptera galatea</i>). The male or female is usually alone sitting on the understory branch of a sapling. It does not fly over the canopy of forest. So, the bird will not sit on top branches of big trees. Actually, there are a lot of birding sites in Sorong regency including the hill forest of Batu Lubang, Klatomok Village Malaumkarta, and Distrik Klayeli.</p>

<p>I saw it for the first time when I guided some French tourists to Malagufuk village in Klasow valley. While we were watching the Lesser Birds of Paradise dancing in a tree in front of us, a local villager who accompanied us told me that a bird of sitting on the branch of a small tree. He was around 2.5 meters above the ground. So, I turned and carefully aimed my Fujifilm HS50EXR at the bird. I shot him several times. Because, we were under the canopy of the forest, there was only a little sunlight. My photographs were not so good. </p>

<p>Since I often guide tourists to Klasow valley, I have more opportunities to take pictures of the birds. The photograph above was taken in the forest of Tambrauw regency.</p><br>
