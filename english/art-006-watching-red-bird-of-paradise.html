	<p>Red Birds of Paradise live in Raja Ampat islands. They have become the main target of watching for tourists who go to the archipelago. 
	</p>
	<h2>Birding Equipment</h2>
	<p>When I guide tourists to watch Red Bird of Paradise, I usually bring some equipment such as binoculars, laser pointer, sound player and loudspeaker, and digital camera. </br>
	I use a pair of Visionking 10Ã—42 mm binoculars to watch the paradise birds in high branches of trees which have been their dancing sites. The binoculars are not the best in the market but they are quite good in producing clear images of the birds.</p>
	<p>I used to bring Fujifilm HS50EXR as my point and shoot camera for taking pictures of birds and anything that I saw while traveling. I broke last year. I have replaced it with Canon 200D and Tamron 150-600 mm G2 telephoto lens. The Fujifilm HS50EXR is lighter than the D-SLR camera with the heavy telephoto lens. Its 1,000 mm lens was very powerful in reaching the birds that were dancing on the top of the trees.</p>
	<p>However, I do not attach photographs of the paradise birds in this article. I prefer colored pencil that have been enhanced with digital lines to the photographs.</p>
	<h2>Bird Art</h2>
	<p>I have created some digital drawings, and watercolor paintings of these beautiful birds. I uploaded them into my website in my Redbubble Nature Art shop. So, they are now available as prints on a lot of products such as mugs, t-shirt, cell phone case, tote bag, sticker, bottles of drinking water. Please, have a look at them at this link: 	</p>
