<body><header><h1>Raja Ampat Snorkeling</h1></header>
<article><p>Raja Ampat is one of the best destinations in Indonesia for snorkeling and other activities related to marine tourism. The coral reef environment in <a href= "../nusantara/raja-ampat.html">Raja Ampat</a> islands have been considered as the richest in the world for its marine bio-diversity. As a tour guide, I offer snorkeling tour for visitor who is interested in seeing various species of fish and marine creatures of the archipelago.</p>
<p>In addition to snorkeling, I include hiking in the rainforest and birding at the beaches to watch paradise birds as well as other tropical birds into the itinerary.</p>
<p>The easiest and the affordable way to experience snorkeling in the area is by staying at one of the many simple guesthouses - also called homestays that is run by local people. These guesthouses are not luxurious but comfortable enough for visitors who like adventure and want to spend a few days to one full week or more exploring the marine life of Raja Ampat.</p>
