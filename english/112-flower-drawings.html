<article><p>I often see flowers when I guide tourists along the coastal and mountainous areas of West Papua. Because I like drawing very much, I create drawings of these flowers. My favorite media is watercolour pencils on paper. Here are some of them</p>

<p>I usually make sketches using ordinary 2B graphite pencils. I don't draw flowers when I see them in the forest, at the beach or at the frontyards of someone's house. I take pictures of the flowers using my cell phone or a pocket camera and use their photographs as my reference. However, I often practice drawing live by putting certain articles such as flower vase, flashlight, bowl, cups, TL lamps and its plug, or even a printer in front of me.</p>
<p>I also make digital drawings. For the vector ones, I use Inkscape and for the bitmap onee, I use Autodesk Sketchbook. In the past, I user Macromedia Freehand. Digital drawing apps can speed up the process of completing a drawing. But a lot of people still give higher appreciation to artworks that are created manually.</p>
<p>Digital drawings can be set to have transparent background which is very important in logo design and digital printing of t-shirts and other print on demand items.</p>

<p>The above drawing can be uploaded into redbubble and zazzle website that sell print on demand products.</p>
<p>Creating digital flower is similar to creating manual drawing. In digital drawing, I use a stylus to draw artworks on the screens of cell phones and tablet. For instance, I drew the hibiscus flower and priamus butterfly below using Samsung Tab A with S-pen. </p>

<p>My favorite drawing application is Autodesk Sketchbook. Because it is a digital artwork, it is saved as a png file that allows a drawing or illustration to have transparent background. This drawing is now available in redbubble. People can buy it as printed products on t-shirts, mugs, shower curtain, pillows, and etc. If you are interested in buying them, please, have a look at the digital artwork at this link: <a rel= "nofollow" href= "https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/24790149" target= "_blank">Hibiscus Flower and Birdwing Butterfly</a></p> </article>
