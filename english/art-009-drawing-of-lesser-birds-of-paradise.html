<p>Lesser Birds of Paradise (<i>Paradisaea minor</i>) is a very beautiful avifauna. It has become an important target for observation by birding tourists. The bird has got golden yellow feather that he uses to attract his female counterpart for mating. </p>
	<p>I have just checked folders of my wildlife drawings to find any sketches or drawings that I haven't uploaded onto this website. There are some of them. So, tonight, I upload a digital drawing of a Male Lesser Birds of Paradise (<em>Paradisaea minor</em>). I created this artwork using stylus and a Samsung Tab A tablet with Autodesk Sketchbook software. </p>

	<p>Before creating the digital drawing, I made a sketch of the bird using pencil on paper. After that, I used watercolour pencils to give the yellow, brown, and green colours for the paradise bird and the branch where he perches on.</p></br>

<p>This tropical bird lives in lowland and lower montane rainforest of New Guinea. It is a unique forest that is very rich with various species of trees, lianas, flower plants, bamboos and mushrooms. In West Papua province of Indonesia, where I live, this paradise bird has become an important target of observations. I often organize birdwatching tours to forests in Manokwari, SorongTambrauw and Raja Ampat. </p>

	<p>The above drawing can now be obtained on various products such as t-shirt, pants, tote bags, mugs, shower curtains, stickers, spiral notebooks and etc. on my online Redbubble shop at this link: <a href= "https://www.redbubble.com/people/leororing/shop?artistUserName=leororing&collections=1078466&iaCode=all-departments&sortOrder=relevant">Tropical Birds Art</a>
	<p> We usually spend 3 to 4 days hiking and exploring the forest to see birds, reptiles, insects, and some mammals. There are a lot of birds that we watch including Magnificent Riflebird, King Bird of Paradise, Hooded Butcherbird, Pink-spotted Fruit Dove, Shining Flycatcher, Northern Variable Pitohui, Spangled Drongo, Eclectus Parrot, Common Paradise Kingfisher, Yellow-billed Kingfisher, Rufous-bellied Kookaburra, Brown Cuckoo Dove, Hooded Pitohui, Yellow-capped Pygmy Parrot, Helmetted Friarbiard, Superb Druit Dove, Papuan Dwarf Kingfisher, Black-capped Lory, and etc.</p>
	<h2>Birding Equipment</h2>
<p>To increase the chance of seeing colorful birds, I bring a Kinglux 20-60×60 mm spotting scope, a pair of Visionking 10×42mm roof prism binoculars, laser pointer. I also bring loudspeaker with a smartphone that contains the recording of bird sounds. Sometimes, I play some bird sounds to attract them.</p>
<p>When the birds are in close range, I use my camera to photograph them. They become my main reference when I make manual and digital drawings of birds that I present in this blog. </p></article>
