<h3>Tropical Rainforest and Wildlife</h3>
<p>There are rainforests in the islands, in the mountains around Wondama Bay, along the coast and tidal areas, as well as in the lowland. These rainforests have got a lot of unique plants and animals. There are trees whose wood is used as important materials for house constructions such as merbau and matoa. There are also trees whose trunk contain starch such as sago and whose fruits are edible such as coconut, bread fruit tree (locally called <i>sukun</i>), mango, and jackfruit.</p>
