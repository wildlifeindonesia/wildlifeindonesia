	<p>Sorong city is the main gate to Raja Ampat. A lot of tourists fly to Domine Eduard Osok airport of Sorong and then continue their trip by passenger ferry to Waisai. Arriving in the small town, they could continue their trip to homestays or beach resorts that are scattered in various big and small islands of Raja Ampat. </p>
	<p>Vacation packages for land tours can be organized from Sorong city. One of the most popular activites is RAINFOREST TOUR. As a tourist guide, I have organized numerous activities for visitors who want to see rainforest with its wealth of bird, insect, reptile, amphibious animals, and mammal diversity. The usual duration of the tour is 3 days/ 2 nights which can be described as follows: </p>
	
<h2>Rainforest Tour in Sorong</h2>
<p><b>Day 1</b></p>
<p>I will meet you at the airport or a hotel in Sorong city. Together we will go to traditional market to buy food materials. After that, we will continue our trip by a 4WD car to rainforest in suburban area of Sorong regency. It takes around 1.5 hours to reach it. We will stop at a homestay in local people's village to unload our bags and food materials. After taking a rest for around 30 minutes to 1 hour, we will begin our rainforest tour to watch tropical birds that fly over the village or sit in the branches of trees along the border of the village with the forest. It is much easier to see birds in the clearing area than under canopy of densed forest. Some birds that we can see include Yellow-faced Myna (<i>Mino dumontii</i>), Golden Myna (<i>Mino anais</i>), Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (<i>Cacatua galerita</i>, Helmetted Friarbird (<i>Philemon buceroides</i>), White-bellied Cuckooshrike, Brahminy Kite (<i>Haliastur indus</i>), Rainbow Bee-eater (<i>Merops ornatus</i>), Oriental Dollarbird (<i>Eurystomus orientalis</i>), and etc.</p>
<p>In addition to birds, we could see various species of butterflies such as Cruiser Butterfly, Silky Owl Butterfly, and Blue Mountain Swallowtail Butterfly.</p></br>
