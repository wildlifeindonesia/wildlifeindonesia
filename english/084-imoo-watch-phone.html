	<p>IMOO is a popular watch phone for children. Parents buy and give it to their children so that they could communicate with them when they are at school or when they go playing with their friends in the neighborhood. Parents can call their children and advise them to avoid playing dangerous games or tell them to return home if necessary. Most parents will feel calm if they can communicate with their children and know where they are.</p>
