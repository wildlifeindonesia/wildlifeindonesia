<article><p>I often make drawings of birds, flowers, butterflies, fish, human figures, landscape and etc.. I draw them manually and digitally. If I draw them manually, I usually use ordinary 2B graphite pencil and watercolour pencils. If I "draw" them digitally, I use vector drawing software such as Macromedia Freehand MX or Inkscape. Today, mobile drawing application allows me to create digital artwork where ever I go. I like using Autodesk Sketchbook. This is not a vector drawing software. So, it is only suitable for creating logos for website, A4 to A3 size digital artworks.</p>

<p>When I guide tourists on a hiking, wildlife watching and birding tours in West Papua, I like to take pictures of birds, wild animals, flowers and other interesting subjects that I see during the trip. Later, when I have returned home, I will use them as references for my drawing works. I start by creating pencil sketch of the bird that I want to draw. After making all the necessary corrections of the sketch, I take picture of the drawing using my smart phone and then redraw the artwork digitally using a stylus and Autodesk Sketchbook. Drawing digitally is similar to drawing on paper. Digital drawing apps. provide huge selection of colours and some tools for editing the artworks. Layers greatly enhance and accelerate the drawing process.</p>
