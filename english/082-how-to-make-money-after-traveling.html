<p>Have you ever thought of making money from your last vacation trip? I just realize that I could still make money from photos that I took during my last tour to Sonder, a small village in North Sulawesi of Indonesia. As a matter of fact, I don't travel very often but I like it very much. I remembered several years ago flying in a budget airline Batavia from Surabaya city to Manado city in Indonesia. I paid around 200 US dollars which I considered expensive at that time. I bought the ticket from a travel agency which had promised a cheap air fare. Well, that price was considered cheap compared to the ticket price charged by other airlines for the same route.</p>
	<img alt="Sonder town in Minahasa regency of Indonesia" src="../images/030-sonder-town.jpg" title="Sonder is a small district town in Minahasa regency of the Provinsi Sulawesi Utara in the Republic of Indonesia" height="287" width="400"><p>After traveling around the city, I continued my trip to a small village in the mountainous region of Minahasa, Sonder village. I enjoyed staying there because the air was fresh and I could see various kinds of flowers. There were not many foreign tourists at that time. But the region is often full with domestic tourists every weekend.</p>
<p>In that village, I walked around every day taking pictures with my Sony cyber-shot. A small but very good digital camera which has ISO features for night photo shoots. I took around 500 photos of the village wooden houses, flowers, and the villagers of course.</p>
<p>One week later, I flew to Manokwari, a town in West Papua which is still surrounded by tropical rainforest where I am settled at the moment. I just forgot all the photos which I shot while visiting Sonder for about two or three months when one day I realized that I could make money from them.</p>
	<img alt="Sunflower at a roadside in tomohon town of North Sulawesi province - Indonesia" src="../images/031-sunflower-in-tomohon.jpg" title="Sunflowers that were growing along the roadside of Tomohon town in the province of North Sulawesi, the Republic of Indonesia."height="538" width="400"><p>Fortunately, I had stored all of the photographs in my Toshiba laptop. When I need them again, they were still there. I wrote an article about flower tourism in Tincep, a smaller village next to Sonder and I sent it to Flona, a national magazines which focuses its discussions on flowers. I did not receive any reply for about 11 months when suddenly a telephone call from one of its staff reminded me about the article which I had forgotten. It was a woman. She asked me to give her my bank account number because she wanted to transfer some money as an honorarium for my article which they would published in November. A few days later, I was able to withdrew the money. For one article that I submitted to the magazine, I got Rp. 350,000 (around 35 US dollars). Well, it is not much but I am happy that the photos that I took during my vacation in Sonder can still be used to make money even until now. How? I have written many articles related to tourism and uploaded them into my websites. One of them is Traveling to the Minahasa Highland.</p>
<p>Actually, there are other ways to make money after traveling such as converting our vacation photos into postcards and selling them through souvenir shops.</p></article><br>
