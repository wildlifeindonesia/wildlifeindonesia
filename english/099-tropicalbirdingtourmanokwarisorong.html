<h1>Tropical Birding Tour in Sorong, Raja Ampat and Tambrauw</h1>
<article><p>Here are some photos of birds in the forest of Arfak mountains that I saw when I guided a Swiss and a Thai tourists on a 4-day/ 3-night hiking and birding-tour. The first one was Black-winged Monarch (<i>Monarcha frater</i>). The bird was quite active in the morning hopping among the branches of Arwop tree. During this tour in tropical montane forest of Manokwari, I also saw Grey-wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) - a migrant bird, Goldenface (Pachycare flavogriseum), Feline Owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles insignis), Sclater's whistler, Vogelkop Melidectes, Ornate Melidectes, Black-breasted Boatbill, Friendly Fantail, Plum-faced Lorikeet, Green-backed Robin, and a lot of other birds.</p>

<p>After guiding tourists in Arfak mountains, I continued my trip to Sorong city where I visited hill forest of the regency. From the short trip, I saw Helmeted Friarbird, Yellow-faced Myna, Oriental Dollarbird, Eclectus Parrot, Palm Cockatoo, Black-capped Lory, Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Black-browed Triller, and Olive-crowned Flowerpecker. I was able to take some pictures of Yellow-bellied Sunbird too.</p>

<p>While birding in Sorong, I also went with my clients to enjoy birding in magrove area where we watched Spotted Dove (an introduced species), Little Egret, Australian Glossy Ibis, Orange Fronted Fruit Dove, and Blue Black Kingfisher. The mangrove forest was located outside of Sorong city and could be reached by a Toyota Avanza car.</p>
<p>To watch several species of birds of paradise, I usually arrange a hiking tour to deeper forest that is the natural habitat of Lesser Birds of Paradise, King Bird of Paradise, Magnificent Riflebird, Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise, and other tropical birds such as Black Lory, Red-cheeked Parrot, Western-crowned Pigeon, Brown-Cuckoo Dove, Wompoo Fruit Dove, Pinon Imperial Pigeon, Lowland Peltop, Yellow-billed Kingfisher, Common Paradise Kingfisher, Azure Kingfisher, Rufous-bellied Kookaburra, Grey-headed Goshawk, Mimic Meliphaga, Hooded Butcherbird and a lot more.</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking a tropical birding tour with me as your guide, you need to fly to Manokwari city or Sorong city (which is the main gate to Raja Ampat). 
I could meet you at the airport or at the hotel where you stay and organize your birdwatching trip to the forest.</p>

<h3>Birding Device</h3>
<p>Birdwatchers usually bring binoculars, spotting scope and telephoto camera. When I went birding in the forest of Sorong, I brought my Fujifilm HS50EXR, with its 42× zoom that was equal to 1,000 mm, I was able to take picture of birds in distant trees. For binoculars, I highly recommend the Swarovski EL 8.5×42 mm or other ones that are equipped with ED lens and Bak4 prism glass. </p>
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>In Manokwari, there are hotels such as Mansinam Beach Hotel, Swiss Belhotel, Aston Niu Hotel, Hotel Valdoz, Hotel Triton that are nice.</p>
<p>For Sorong city, because it is the main gate to Raja Ampat, visitors can stay in Kyriad M Hotel, M Express Hotel, Swissbel Hotel, Le Meridien, Vega Hotel, Belagri Hotel, Mariat hotel and a lot more. </p>
<p>Hotels can be booked from online booking websites such as traveloka, booking.com and etc.</p>
