	 <p>Here is my drawing of Black-capped Lory (<i>Lorius lory</i>) that I created using sketchbook on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S-pen tablet. I took around 1 hour for me to make the sketch and did the finishing of the feather. The use of Tablet as drawing media has revolutionized the creativity of artists who want to create any kind of drawings anywhere and anytime.</p>
	 <p> As a tourist guide, I often accompany birdwatchers on hiking trips in the lowland forest of Manokwari or Sorong regency. I see Black-capped Lory and a lot of other birds eating nectar of flowers or fruits in tall trees. To watch birds, I offer a good pair of binoculars to my guests. In addition to birds, visitors can see colorful butterflies, beetles, grasshopper, dragonflies, lizards, and even wallaby while walking in the jungle.  </p>
	 <p> Birds are usually active in the mornings and in the evenings. For Black-capped Lory, the easiest way to see the bird is by going to flowering or fruiting trees. Black-capped Lory is often seen in groups or together with other groups of smaller birds such as Rainbow Lorikeet. </br>
