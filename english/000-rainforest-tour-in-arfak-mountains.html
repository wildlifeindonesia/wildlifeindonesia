	 <p>Hiking Camping and Wildlife Watching</p>
	<p>The best way to watch wild animals in the jungle of Mount Susnguakti of Arfak Mountains is by staying there for several nights. As a tourist guide, I provide tents, cooking and eating utensils that visitors can use during the rainforest tour. The tents are located near a small stream.</p>

	<p>To watch <a href= "071-lesser-birds-of-paradise-in-susnguakti-forest.html">Lesser Birds of Paradise (<i>Paradisaea minor</i>)</a>, visitors need to wake up early in the morning at 05.00. After drinking some tea or coffee and eating bread or biscuits, they need to start hiking to the birding site located approximately 30 minutes away from the basecamp. Birds of Paradise and other birds are usually active from 5.30 to 09.00.  The birding trip can be continued to higher elevation area to watch King Bird of Paradise (<i>Cicinnurus regius</i>). The male bird has got red color on its back and wings and white color on its belly. </p>
	<p>During the day, visitors can go hiking in the forest to see unique plants, jungle lizards, and butterflies. In rainy season, a lot of species of mushrooms grow on the ground and during dry season certain trees can be seen covered by their flowers. The exploration of the forest can be done at night to see cuscus possum, glowing mushroom, fireflies. Sometimes, the sounds of Papuan Frogmouth bird can be heard in trees.</p>
