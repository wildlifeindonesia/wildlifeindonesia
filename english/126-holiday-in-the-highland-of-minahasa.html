<p><b>Sonder Town</b> is another interesting destination which visitors can see while traveling in the highland of Minahasa. It is a real farming town. We could see fish ponds and pigpens as well as poultry farming in the surrounding area of Sonder. Farmers of Sonder plant clove trees at the frontyards and backyard of their houses. Clove flower used to be the main commodity that is produced by farmers in Sonder. During harvest season, farmers dry clove flowers at the frontyard of their houses. When sunlight hit the clove flowers and dry them, oil from evaporates from them. This creates fragrant smell along the road sides of Sonder town.  Now they plant rice, raise chickens and do fish-farming. Because of the availability of water in this area, the population of water birds is very high. Birdwatchers could find Black-crowned White Eye, Sulawesi Hanging Parrots, Soooty-headed Bulbul, Finch-billed Myna, Cattle Egret, Grey Heron. Other birds can also be watched in Sonder. They include Black-naped Oriole, Grey-sided Flowerpecker, Pale Blue Monarch, Finch-billed Myna, Sooty-headed Bulbul, Yellow-billed Malkoha, Sulawesi Drongo, Sahul Sunbird, and etc.</p>
