<h2>Birdwing Butterfly Ornithoptera priamus</h2>
<p>The color and soft fragrance of Hibiscus flowers attract insects to eat its nectar. One of them is Birdwing Butterfly whose wingspan can reach 22 cm. Birdwing butterflies are beautiful insects that attract the attention of photographers, painters and insect collectors. Ornithoptera priamus is the most common species that can be found along the coastal area of the Pacific region. The male has got green and black colors whereas the female one has got brown to dark, white and yellow colors. Female  is usually bigger that the male.</p>
<h2>Coastal Development and Habitat Loss</h2>
<p>Although birdwing butterfly Ornithoptera priamus is still abundant in many islands between Australia and Southeast Asia, their population is significantly reduced due to rapid development of human settlements in highly populated islands. Habitat loss can be seen in New Guinea where huge areas of lowland forest in the coastal region is cut.
